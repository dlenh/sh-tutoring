# Tutoring Website for Samantha Hong
The endgoal of this project was to create a landing page for my client so that she can have web presence for her tutoring business. A form was included so that inquiries can be sent to her.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GetForm

 An [HTML5Up template](https://html5up.net/miniport) was used as a foundation. The color scheme, sectioning/formatting, and font awesome icons were adjusted according to the client. There is a navigation bar up top to easily access the corresponding sections: about me, services, testimonies, contact. Keyphrases were bolded throughout the body to capture the audience's attention and to improve search engine optimization (SEO). A call-to-action was included in the structure of a form that allows potential customers to contact the client. [GetFrom](https://getform.io/), a backend for forms, was used to collect submissions; client would be alerted via email of new inquiries.  

## Lesson Learned: 

Templates can be used instead of writing the HTML boilerplate from scratch. This allows for more focus on the content rather than the design. Weekly meetings with client to update progress were invaluable and I am glad she is happy with the final product.
